Because of that, the\n// following regular expression fails because the\n// dot operator, while supposedly matching a\n// single character, actually matches a single\n// code point.\nconsole.log(s.match(/I got the . on me!/));\n\n// Now, with the \"u\" flag, regular expressions\n// with character patters like \".\", \"?\", and\n// \"{}\" will correctly recognize multi-code-\n// point characters.\nconsole.log(s.match(/I got the . on me!/u));"
